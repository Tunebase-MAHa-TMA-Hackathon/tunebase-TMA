## Introduction

Tunebase is a decentralized music streaming platform powered by the Base blockchain & Biconomy AA, aiming to create a peer-to-peer bridge between artists and listeners.

Please note that this is an **alpha prototype** of Tunebase. This early version is to provide a glimpse and working functionality of the platform. The final product may have significant differences, additional features, and polished user interfaces. Your feedback at this stage is invaluable to help us iterate and improve!

## Getting Started

### Running the Web App Locally

To get Tunebase running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have `Node.js` and `npm` installed.

2. Clone the repository to your local machine.

3. Navigate to the root folder of the project and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

4. To run the development server, use: `npm run dev`.

#### Smart Contract on Testnet

Our smart contract has been deployed on the testnet. This allows developers to interact with it, test its functionalities, and build on top of it without using real assets. The address and ABI for the smart contract is already set in all dependecies.

## Features

### Web3 Integration

Artists and listeners can establish seamless interactions via wallets available on Base (e.g. Metamask).

### NFT Minting

- **Minting:** Fans can mint artists' songs as NFTs.
